""" Imagine you are a cyber security specialist and your job is to make sure that all systems in the
company you work for is searched and cleaned for threats of hacking or viruses during a particular
timeframe(hourly, 10-minutes, daily, 5-seconds).
You have a function that performs that task and have kept it safe on the systems.
Would it not be tedious to wake up every morning, or check hourly, or every five seconds to run that
or call that function. Now imagine you have to do it for different departments,
or worse-since you are a remote worker- work for about 5 companies and have to run it for all their
departments.

Do no despair, we have loops in out arsenal. Loops are a paradigm that makes it possible for us
to perform a repetitive task when a condition is met. Take for example the code below 
    
while True:
    run clean()
    wait 5 seconds


def deep_scan():
    if virus or hack:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def clean():
    return 'message: SYSTEM CLEARED FOR THREATS'


while deep_scan():
    run clean()
    wait 5 seconds    
Loops have two parts:the head-which contains the conditon to check before the code runs
-and the body-which contains the action to be performed."""
